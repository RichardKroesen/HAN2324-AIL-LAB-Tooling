# Example (mini) projects

## Volume control using head tilt
Detect head movement through accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to perform actions such as controlling headset volume.

## Worker protection and monitoring
Ensure worker safety by monitoring protective gear usage and providing real-time feedback on safety-critical applications.

## Asset or parcel tracking
Give an asset context to where it is in the overall supply chain through analysis of real-time sensor data, to ensure more on-time deliveries.

## Equipment predictive maintenance
Predict motors, pumps or machinery failure using sensor or audio data to proactively perform maintenance and reduce factory downtime. Low-latency real-time system monitoring and failure identification, e.g. fan vibration state monitoring.

## Human activity detection
We can distinguish precisely if the user is walking (typically 1 - 2 Hz) versus jogging (2.5 - 4 Hz) through the use of appropriate filters. Filter selection should be done by doing Fourier analysis and observing Power spectral density of signal.

## Interaction with a product
For example an alarm clock: by shaking the clock the alarm turns off. And by tilting the clock, the alarm time can be adjusted.

## Making a game
Move a puzzle box in a specific sequence (e.g. a codex) to open it.

## Anomaly detection
Detect abnormal behaviour, for example by measuring the vibration of a motor. With low or no vibration, everything is okay, but high vibration must be detected and signalled to an operator.

## Yoga pose recognition
Detect yoga poses by applying one or more sensors to the human body. How many poses would you like to distinguish, what sensors might be needed and where should these sensors be located on the body?

## Squats counter
Similar to yoga pose recognition: detect different kinds of squats and count them.

## Fitness toy
Like product interaction, but think of exercise movements you can do with the toy.

## Challenge:

### Concept & Design:

Briefly describe your product idea.
- How does it address the needs of your target audience?
- Sketch or create a simple visual representation of your product.
- Consider the accessibility of your product for people with different physical limitations.
- Research existing fitness products to identify strengths and weaknesses and leverage them for your design.

Functionality:
- How will users interact with your product?
- What types of exercises will it offer?
- Will it provide any additional features like progress tracking, challenges, or social interaction?

Motivation & Fun:
- How will your product make exercise more engaging and enjoyable?
- Consider elements like gamification, music, or personalized routines.

Marketing:
- Create a short tagline or slogan that captures the essence of your product.
- Briefly explain how you would market your product to your target audience.

Deliverables:
- A one-page document outlining your concept, design, functionality, and marketing strategy.
- Include any sketches or visual aids that represent your product.
- Prototype and code
